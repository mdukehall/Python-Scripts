# Python-Scripts

## Purpose
This repo is inspired from personal readings on Python.  Much of this comes from books and blogs related to networking or information security.  Never having had formal networking education I enjoy learning by doing.  Additionally, as a web technician, I din it's extremely important to understand the attack surface of the web applications or API's I create; hence the information security interest.

## Usage
All exmaples in this repo are for Python 2.X and not 3.  <br>
